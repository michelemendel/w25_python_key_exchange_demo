# W25 Python Final Project - Key Exchange Demo

This project demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, which allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Demo

```bash
python key_exchange_demo.py
or
./key_exchange_demo.py
```

The program will guide you through each step of the key exchange process, waiting for you to press Enter to continue to the next step.
